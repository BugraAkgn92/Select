## 🧠 Game Concept

In *Select*, the player is presented with random life events.
Each event has **two choices**, and each choice directly affects your stats.

Your goal is to balance:

* 💰 **Money**
* 👨‍👩‍👦 **Family**
* 🏢 **Corporate Power**
* 😊 **Happiness**

If any of these reach zero, special custom events trigger — and your life changes dramatically.

## 🕹️ How It Works

Each event contains:

* 🖼️ An image
* 📝 A description
* 🔘 Two selectable options
* ⚙️ Two different stat effects

Example event:

> “A salary crisis broke out among employees at the company”

Choices:

* "Give them what they want"
* "No we can't give any more money"

Each option modifies stats differently.

## ⚠️ Custom Events

Special endings occur when:

* Happiness ≤ 0
* Corporate ≤ 0
* Family ≤ 0

These events override normal gameplay and lead to alternate story outcomes.

Example:

* Lose your company
* Live alone
* Rebuild your empire

## 🎯 Gameplay Goal

Balance your life.

Too much work? You lose your family.
Too much family time? You lose corporate power.
Too much stress? You lose happiness.

Every decision matters.
